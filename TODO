- Read arff file (rarff)
- Support for partitions on numeric data? (everything looks integer so we can treat it as discrete)
- Calculate partitions (hash of arrays?)
- Determine if partitions are equivalent (O(awful))
- Determinie if a partition is minimal (O(worse))
- Induce rules from partitions ("easy")
